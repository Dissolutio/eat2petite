				<h2 className='text-center'>About Eat-2-Petite</h2>
				<p>
					Eat 2 Petite was born from a simple thought:
					</p>
				<Blockquote>
					I need to lose weight, but I cannot stop eating!
					I wish I could just eat my way to thin...
					<span>Everybody</span>
				</Blockquote>
				<p>
					Eat 2 Petite is not a one-size-fits-all diet plan. Here, we believe that every personâ€™s life, environment, tastes, and economic situations are unique.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eat 2 Petite wants to teach you about nutrition and how to navigate around unhealthy habits.
