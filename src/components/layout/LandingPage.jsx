				<h2 className='text-center'>About Eat-2-Petite</h2>
				<p>
					Eat 2 Petite was born from a simple thought that most people experience. <strong>I need to lose weight, but I cannot stop eating!</strong> I wish I could just eat my way to thin. 
					</p>
					<p>
					However, not everyone wants to lose weight. Some are content with their weight, some want to gain weight, some just want more energy, and some want something new. The nutritional coaching services that Eat 2 Petite provides will help with any of these goals. It is tinkered and tweaked to be what you desire. A personal coach will discuss your goals, preferences, and habits to make your meal plans.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eat 2 Petite is not a one-size-fits-all diet plan. Here, we believe that every person’s life, environment, tastes, and economic situations are unique. One diet that may work well for the at-home-mom that loves to cook may not work for the traveling male executive that lives on lunch and dinner meetings.
				</p>
				<p>
					Eat 2 Petite wants to teach you about nutrition and how to navigate around unhealthy habits. Founded by Jennifer Dotson, a mother of 3 boys, a wife, a student,  a surgical technologist who specializes in cardiac surgery, and now a business owner. Her many roles in life have given her the ability to relate to a variety of people and  achieve success in individualized diet plans.
					</p>
					<p>
					Eat 2 Petite strives to simplify and clarify the world of nutrition while educating the community through sharing blogs, vlogs, and recipes. Follow Eat 2 Petite in the learning and coaching that Jennifer implements in her clients’ lives.
